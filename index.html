                        It is a period of civil war.
                        Rebel spaceships, striking
                        from a hidden base, have won
                        their first victory against
                        the evil Galactic Empire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the battle, Rebel
                        spies managed to steal secret
                        plans to the Empire's
                        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
                        STAR, an armored space
                        station with enough power to
                        destroy an entire planet.

                        Pursued by the Empire's
                        sinister agents, Princess
                        Leia races home aboard her
                        starship, custodian of the
                        stolen plan that can save
                        her people and restore
                        freedom to the galaxy....
